DCP's [ZoLa](http://maps.nyc.gov/zola) tool is a web map that allows users to visually inspect zoning boundaries, special zoning districts, and other critical spatial information that impacts land use and zoning throughout the city. It currently allows users to toggle several relevant layers on a map, inspect layers with tooltips, and search for specific locations to get site-specific zoning information

This project will involve a re-thinking of ZoLa from the ground up. User-centered design combined with agile processes and modern geospatial and front-end web technology will allow for the addition of key features that may not have been feasible under the existing site. The project will also bring ZoLa in-house, where DCP can have a direct channel for implementing new features as use cases arise.
