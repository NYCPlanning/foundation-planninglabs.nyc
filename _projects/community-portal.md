The interactive Community Portal will help Community Boards, developers, city agencies, students, planners and local residents get a quick overview of the physical and socio-economic conditions in a particular community district. It will include data-driven web maps and charts for selected community indicators, and provide quick links to critical community district resources from DCP and other agencies.

This project is a new implementation of the [existing community portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/community/community-portal.page), currently available on the DCP website.
