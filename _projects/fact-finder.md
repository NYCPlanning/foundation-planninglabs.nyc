The current version of [NYC Census FactFinder](http://maps.nyc.gov/census/) is unique in providing detailed population and housing profiles, with data reliability calculated on the fly, for user-defined geographies. The application has developed a broad and diverse user base, including institutions, like hospitals, schools, and libraries, as well as numerous city agencies â€“ and particularly City Planning.

This project will involve a re-thinking of FactFinder from the ground up. User-centered design combined with agile processes and modern geospatial and front-end web technology will allow for the addition of key features that may not have been feasible under the existing site. The project will also bring FactFinder in-house, where DCP can have a direct channel for implementing new features as use cases arise.
