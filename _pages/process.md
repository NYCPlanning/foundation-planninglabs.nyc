<h2 id="step-1" data-magellan-target="step-1">Step 1: Idea Submission</h2>
<h6>Customer</h6>
DCP staff submit a clearly defined problem that needs solving, such as a real-world planning issue, a minor technical workflow improvement, or something in between.

<a class="button" href="https://ideas.planninglabs.nyc/create">Submit an idea</a>

<h2 id="step-2" data-magellan-target="step-2">Step 2: Idea Vetting</h2>
<h6> Labs + Customer</h6>
When an idea is submitted, the Planning Labs team starts a dialogue with the customer to determine if it's a good candidate for a Labs project.  

- Subject matter and data can be openly discussed
- Minimum viable product is achievable in 4 to 6 weeks
- Technical fit for the skillset of the Planning Labs team
- Alignment with DCP mission and strategic objectives

<h2 id="step-3" data-magellan-target="step-3">Step 3: Idea Listing</h2>
<h6> Everyone</h6>
Vetted ideas enter a public listing where stakeholders can promote their idea through open discussion. Although the ideas in this list may be a good fit, they're not Labs projects yet.

<a class="button" href="https://ideas.planninglabs.nyc/">View the ideas list</a>

<h2 id="step-4" data-magellan-target="step-4">Step 4: Project Selection</h2>
<h6> Executive Office + Labs</h6>
Each time the Planning Labs team completes a project, the Chief Operating Officer selects a new project from the ideas list.

<h2 id="step-5" data-magellan-target="step-5">Step 5: Pipeline Posting</h2>
<h6> Everyone</h6>
When a new project is selected, it's added to the pipeline on our website, which contains three projects&mdash;our currently active project, and the next two on deck.
